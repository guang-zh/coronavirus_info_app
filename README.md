# coronavirus_info_app
The pandemic COVID not only brings people fear, but also leads to increasing data, which should be more accessible and easily visualized for the public.

1. Web scrapping directly from Worldometers https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
2. Scrape from local saved html pages from Worldometers
3. Save to MySQL Database and as CSV files
4. Data Exploration and Visualization: User choose interested Country, check Graphs for new cases, new deaths, new recovered, and neighbouring countries by border distances

Application will be done using Django, and still in progress.
